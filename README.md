**Project Overview**

This repository contains simple Java solutions and practice files for Hackerrank-style exercises.

**Contents**
- [inpu.java](inpu.java) — sample input/helper (if present)
- [Loop.java](Loop.java) — main example demonstrating loops

**Requirements**
- **Java:** JDK 8 or later

**Build & Run**
- Compile all Java files in the project root:

```bash
javac *.java
```

- Run a specific class (for example `Loop`):

```bash
java Loop
```

If the class has a `package` declaration, run it using the fully-qualified name from the project root.

**Usage Notes**
- Place any input files in the project root and update the code to read from them if required.
- For online judges (Hackerrank), submit only the class and methods required by the problem statement.

**Testing**
- There are no automated tests included. To try examples, run the compiled classes and provide input via stdin or temporary files.

**Contributing**
- Open an issue or submit a pull request with improvements, additional exercises, or clearer problem descriptions.
